# datascience-postgreSQL--IMDB
IMDB database study in PostgreSQL


We provide a set of files here: [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-t46vy8xexNKruJFe4zBCzRRbG29weyp). Each file comprises the tuples of one relation; the relations, together, model the data from the Internet movie database (IMDB, in short). The smallest has 4 tuples, the largest has more than 5 million tuples.

The data files have a total size of a few Gigabytes. You will have to:

    1. Load each separate file into a table in Postgres; you will have to create the tables with the appropriate key and foreign key constraints. Loading the data is trivial and may take some time, both to get it right, and then to run (actually load data into the server).

    2. Write queries for specific tasks. For this, you will have to provide: the queries; their results.
